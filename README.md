# Passing_Data_Between_Activities
demonstrated how to launch another activity using the startActivity()
method. One common task you need to perform when launching another activity is passing some
data to it. For example, you might want to launch another activity to collect some user-related data,

the data also needs to be passed back to the calling activity. Hence, you need to be able to pass data
back and forth between activities. This recipe shows you how.
